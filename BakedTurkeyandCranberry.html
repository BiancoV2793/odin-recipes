        <img src="../images/BakedTurkeyandCranberrySliders.jpg">
        <p>These are a take on the popular baked ham and Swiss sliders with a holiday twist. They also taste great with leftover roasted turkey and French fried onions.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>½ stick butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons Dijon mustard, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried minced onion</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 (12 count) package Hawaiian bread rolls, split</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ (14 ounce) can jellied cranberry sauce</li>
            <li>½ pound cooked honey-roasted turkey, shaved</li>
            <li>6 slices Havarti cheese, cut into halves</li>
            <li>1 cup arugula (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch pan with cooking spray.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Whisk melted butter with Dijon mustard, dried onion, and Worcestershire in a small bowl.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Place the bottom halves of the rolls into the prepared pan. Spread mayonnaise and additional Dijon mustard to taste along the rolls. Spread cranberry sauce. Add turkey and 1/2 slice of cheese to each. Top with arugula and top halves of the rolls. Spread melted butter mixture evenly over tops. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, uncover, and continue to bake until cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
